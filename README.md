#### Windows

Starting with Visual Studio 2017, the project folder can simply be opened with Visual Studio and built.

#### Linux

Simply running `cmake && make` should suffice.

### Documentation
Documentation on various different file formats used throughout Black and White can all be
found in the `docs` folder in the project root directory.

features or bug fixes, documenting new file formats or simply editing some
grammar.
